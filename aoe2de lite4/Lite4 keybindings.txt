the Lite4 folder should go in:
C:\Steam\userdata\{random-number}\813780\remote\Lite4\Base.hkp

Found the Lite4.hkp lone file in:
C:\Steam\userdata\{random-number}\813780\remote\Lite4.hkp

Might also need to upload it to
%USERPROFILE%\Games\Age of Empires 2 DE\{your-steam-id}\profile\{profile-name}.hki
